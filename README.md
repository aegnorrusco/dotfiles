#Readme
My personal configuration. 

##Instalation
Download this little script and pray :)\
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balthmort/dotfiles/master/install.sh`

#Note
Everything here (except forked part) is highly experimental, I am still learnig
with all this config stuff, so sometimes things might not be working. I do my
best to make them functional but sometimes it takes time. Sorry.

#Documentation
In time there will be documentation for every part of this, but now the is
simply not enought time for me to do it.


#Thanks
All hail great commandy one [Khardix](https://github.com/khardix) because his configs I used as inspiration
and forked them.
